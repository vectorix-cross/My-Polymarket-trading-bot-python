## 1. Polymarket Momentum Arbitrage bot (Twap-60s Available) (Introduction)

A high-frequency Polymarket Trading bot for short-duration prediction markets that combines real-time YES/NO pricing, order-book depth, liquidity imbalance, external BTC/ETH price feeds, and short-term momentum signals to identify market inefficiencies. 

The strategy continuously calculates momentum and market-state signals to estimate short-term directional probability, then dynamically adjusts YES/NO allocation while maintaining a controlled two-sided exposure. 

It uses automated limit-order execution and position management to capture multiple small arbitrage and momentum-driven opportunities throughout a market cycle rather than relying on a single directional trade. 

The system is designed for concurrent order management, with configurable exposure, position sizing, liquidity conditions, and capital buffers for unsettled positions and redemption delays. 

With approximately $2,500 recommended starting capital, the bot is optimized for continuous automated execution across multiple short-term Polymarket markets while applying exposure and volatility-aware risk controls.

## 2. Polymarket TWAP Reversal bot (Introduction)


A specialized trading bot designed to identify short-term reversal opportunities in Polymarket 5-minute and 15-minute crypto markets after the TWAP-60s upgrade. 

The bot continuously monitors TWAP price movements, prediction-token price changes, market conditions, and on-chain signals to detect potential whale-driven reversals. 

Its professional signal model analyzes these real-time indicators, particularly during the final 90 seconds when BTC TWAP is near the market boundary, to estimate which token has the highest probability of winning. 

When a high-confidence reversal signal is detected, the bot automatically enters the expected winning token at an opportunistic price. 

The goal is to capture short-term inefficiencies created by sudden market reversals while maintaining systematic, data-driven execution.

## 3. Polymarket TWAP Winning token Sniper bot (Introduction)

This Polymarket TWAP winning token sniper bot targets short-duration (5- and 15-minute) crypto prediction markets on Polymarket, sniping the high-probability winning token near resolution when the underlying asset has clearly moved away from the reference price. It confirms direction using both live spot price and Chainlink TWAP, estimates win probability, and only buys when the executable order-book price still offers positive expected edge after costs. Strict risk checks, data freshness validation, and latency-aware execution keep the strategy systematic rather than a simple “buy the winner” approach.

## 5. Polymarket 5min BTC Liquidity Momentum Arbitrage Bot

BTC Liquidity Momentum Arbitrage Bot is a Polymarket trading bot that monitors the BTC 5-minute Up/Down markets by analyzing real-time order book liquidity instead of relying only on price movements. It detects sudden shifts in buying or selling pressure using an order-book influence metric and confirms the signal with the difference between the live Bitcoin spot price and the market's strike price before placing its first trade (Buy1). After the initial order is filled, the bot immediately attempts to buy the opposite side (Buy2) at a calculated complementary price so the combined position costs about $0.95 while redeeming for $1.00 at market settlement. Rather than acting as a last-second sniper, This is a market microstructure strategy that exploits temporary liquidity imbalances and order-flow inefficiencies throughout most of the five-minute trading window.

## 6. Polymarket BTC ETH Hug Bot

Polymarket BTC & ETH Hug Bot is a signal-driven trading system designed for short-duration Polymarket prediction markets.

## 10. Polymarket Arbitrage Bot (Lost token sniper) : (Introduction)

Polymarket Arbitrage Lost token Sniper bot automates a trading workflow on Polymarket short-interval markets (e.g., BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP 5-minute “up/down” epochs). It allocates capital into YES and NO positions, monitors order books in real time, and strategically exits the predicted losing side token before market resolution to optimize returns. The core edge lies in the model’s ability to accurately identify the losing token, enabling consistent profit capture when combined prices exceed $1.

## 12. Polymarket Arbitrage Bot (Dual-side) : (Introduction)
This Polymarket trading bot explores an automated volatility and probability arbitrage bot designed to identify pricing inefficiencies in prediction markets. Instead of predicting outcomes, the system exploits mispriced probabilities, market imbalances, and short-term volatility using quantitative models and automation. By combining high-frequency execution with strong risk management and hedging, the bot aims to capture small statistical edges and compound them over large trade volumes. 🚀

# 14. Polymarket Arbitrage Bot (Stair Trading) : (Introduction)
The Stair Arbitrage Bot is designed to optimize position unwinding within Polymarket’s short-duration markets, with a particular focus on the final phase of each 5-minute interval. As markets approach resolution, the system executes a disciplined and liquidity-aware exit strategy across both YES and NO positions.

Execution begins with the selective liquidation of the side offering the most favorable order book conditions, leveraging real-time depth and pricing signals to minimize market impact. Following this initial reduction in exposure, the bot systematically unwinds the opposing position—either through staged, price-sensitive increments or via a single coordinated execution—utilizing its proprietary Stair-based logic.

This execution framework is underpinned by a robust risk management architecture and dynamic hedging mechanisms, enabling controlled exposure, reduced volatility, and consistent capital preservation. The overall design prioritizes efficient exits, minimized slippage, and stable, repeatable performance across varying market conditions.
